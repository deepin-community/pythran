Comment:
 According to upstream comments in the source file, this file is a derivative
 from two sources: Python packages "cgen" and "codepy", both by Andreas
 Kloeckner and under MIT license. Upstream comments in the source file:
 # Serge Guelton: The licensing terms are not set in the source package, but
 # pypi[1] says the software is under the MIT license, so I reproduce it here
 # [1] http://pypi.python.org/pypi/cgen
 .
 # copy-pasted from codepy.bpl, which is a real mess...
 # the original code was under MIT License
 # cf. http://pypi.python.org/pypi/codepy
 # so I reproduce it here
